### User Stories
The issues/ user stories were broken down into different categories, developer, visitor, registered-user and admin user stories. This was to separate concerns and ensure that all user functionality was being added. I added personalised labels to the issues so I could see which categories each issue was separated into, and how many from each section I was still working on to complete.

## Wireframes
I used Figma to create basic wireframes for standard screensizes:
<details><summary>Home Page</summary><img src="#"></details>
<details><summary>Bookstore</summary><img src=""></details>
<details><summary>Customer Service</summary><img src=""></details>


## Database Schema
I used Lucid Chart to create basic Entity Relationship Diagrams for database schema:
- Note : one missing - explain

## Design and Layout
### Typography

Inika Font is a serif typeface designed with elegance and readability in mind. Its soft, well-balanced letterforms make it ideal for both print and digital platforms. I decided to use this font for:
- Readability: The serif design enhances legibility, especially in longer articles, making it perfect for news content.
- Professional Aesthetic: Inika has a formal yet approachable look, adding credibility to journalistic content.
- Versatility: It works well on various screen sizes, providing a consistent reading experience on mobile and desktop.
- Distinctive Style: Its unique design helps a news blog stand out while maintaining a polished appearance.
### Colour Scheme

### Images
I tried to carefully select the images to match the overall theme and aesthetic of the site. I tried to use complimenting colours where possible.
<details><summary>Home Page Banner</summary><img src=""></details>
<details><summary>About Page Banner</summary><img src=""></details>
<details><summary>Profile Page</summary><img src=""></details>

### Responsiveness
Website is response across all device screen sizes :
<details><summary>Home Page Mobile</summary><img src=""></details>
<details><summary>Home Page Tablet</summary><img src=""></details>
<details><summary>Home Page Desktop</summary><img src=""></details>
